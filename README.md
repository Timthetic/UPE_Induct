# UPE_Induct
This is my solution to the UPE Fall 2018 Coding Challenge.  It's ugly and proud.

You should be able to use '$ python3 main.py' in the same directory as main.py to run this script.
If you can't, make sure python 3 is installed.  Try '$ brew install python'.

The program will spit out a bunch of information as it solve the mazes including the response it gets for the stats of
each maze, a picture of the maze (with the path it has taken), and the walls it knows about.  It will also spit out 
information about what points it considered moving to.
